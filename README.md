# Engineering enhanced elastic wave propagation with state-dependent stiffness

Python and MATLAB implementations of the numerical methods supporting *Engineering enhanced elastic wave propagation with state-dependent stiffness* by Cl√©ment Moreau, Benjamin J. Walker, Rebecca N. Poon, Daniel Soto, Daniel I. Goldman, Eamonn A. Gaffney, and Kirsty Y. Wan.

## Low-amplitude
A Python script that runs and saves a simulation of a low-amplitude PDE model with state-dependent stiffness. A working installation of (legacy) [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) is required.

A sample MATLAB plotting script is also included: call `plotSol` with the output directory as an argument to generate a plot of the beat.
